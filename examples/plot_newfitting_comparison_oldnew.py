================================================================================
Compare performance between old 1T fitting example and new fitting module
================================================================================

RADIS has its own fitting feature, as shown in 1 temperature fit example, where you have
to manually create the spectrum model, input the experimental spectrum and other ground-truths
into numerous RADIS native functions, as well as adjust the fitting pipeline yourself.

Now with the new fitting module implemented on September 6 2022, all you have to do is to prepare a
.spec file containing your experimental spectrum, fill some JSON forms describing the ground-truth
conditions just like how you fill your medical checkup paper, call the function fit_spectrum() and
let it do all the work! If you are not satisfied with the result, you can simply adjust the parameters
in your JSON, then recall the function again, until the results are satisfied.

This is way easier and more convenient than dwelling into RADIS documentation to find out and
learn how to use the current example, especially for new RADIS users. This new fitting module
aims to provide an end-to-end fitting experience, with minimum amount of RADIS knowledge needed.

This example will run both fitting methods on an experimental spectrum with the same ground-truth
conditions, so you can compare their overall performance, including number of loops, fitting time,
and final residuals between experimental and best-fit spectra, as an indicator of fit accuracy.

"""

From the comparative result above, which includes last residual, total time fitting and total number of
fitting loops of each fitting method, we can see that under exactly the same ground-truth conditions,
fitting method (L-BFGS-B) and fitting pipeline, we can see that the new fitting module provides a better
accuracy, while requiring less fitting loops and time for execution.

You are free to change the experimental spectrum and its accompanied ground-truth conditions, but please
make sure to keep the same inputs between the two for a transparent comparative result.
